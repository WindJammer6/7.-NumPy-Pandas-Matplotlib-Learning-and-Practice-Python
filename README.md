# NumPy-Pandas-Matplotlib-Learning-and-Practice-Python :heavy_plus_sign::panda_face::chart_with_downwards_trend:
My learning journey of Python's Libraries NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Thoughts on starting this learning journey
Back in my fifth project on Alarm Clock (no GUI) I mentioned that I discovered a new way to learn programming languages: Through the learning of libraries.

Through applying for IT internships and some readups online I also realised some popular libraries that are a must-know as professional skills in Python in the working world. Said libraries include NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib so here they are.

I'm sure what I posed here definitely isn't everything there is about the libraries and there is a good chance that I may just be scratching the surface on the knowledge and the contents of these libraries. I'll keep learning as time goes on on what there is to know.

**1. NumPy Learning**

What is NumPy?

From online: "NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays."

The code and data that I put into the 'Numpylearn' folder is taken from and in order of this video's contents.

**2. NumPy Practices**

<br>

**3. Pandas Learning**

What is Pandas?

From online: "Pandas is an open-source library built on top of NumPy providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation. It excels in performance and productivity."

**4. Pandas Practices**

Source(s): https://pynative.com/python-pandas-exercise/ (PyNative)

The coding excercises and data I put into 'Pandaspractice' folder is taken from and in order of this website's contents.

Practices done by myself. Solutions that look quite different from my answers(or if my answers are wrong) I have attached the solutions in the folder as well.

**5. Matplotlib Learning**

**6. Matplotlib Practices**
